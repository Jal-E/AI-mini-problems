AI Mini Problem Solutions

This repository contains implementations of three classic AI problems using various algorithms. Each project has its own detailed README with specific instructions.

Projects Overview

1. 4-in-a-Line AI Game

    An AI implementation for the 4-in-a-Line game using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

2. 8-Puzzle Solver
   
    An A* search algorithm solver for the 8-puzzle game, utilizing misplaced tiles and Manhattan distance heuristics.

3. N-Queen Problem Solutions
   
    Implementations of the Steepest-Ascent Hill Climbing Algorithm and the Genetic Algorithm for solving the N-Queen problem.

General Requirements

    Python 3.x
    NumPy library (for some projects)
